# Hi, I'm Christoffer (jrnker)

I build small, sharp utilities and libraries for .NET â€” things that solve real problems with minimal ceremony.  
ðŸ‘‰ **All projects:** <https://github.com/jrnker>

## Featured projects

- **SimpleProxy** â€” Minimal forward proxy in C#/.NET 8; plain HTTP + HTTPS tunneling via CONNECT.  
  [Repo â†’](https://github.com/jrnker/SimpleProxy)

- **PKUL** â€” Public Key User Login, distributes ssh public keys across systems based on a key file in a git repo.  
  [Repo â†’](https://github.com/jrnker/PKUL)

- **Proxmea.ILoggerN** â€” Opinionated NLog-based ILogger setup for .NET 8 with DI, property logging, and Elastic-friendly layouts. Handles file, console and Elastic as default. Built to be very easy to implement.

- **Blake3Console** â€” Tiny tool to compute BLAKE3 hashes from CLI or Explorer context menu.  
  [Repo â†’](https://github.com/jrnker/Blake3Console)

- **mRemoteNG_PuttyImporter** â€” Import PuTTY sessions into mRemoteNGâ€™s `confCons.xml` without duplicates.

  [Repo â†’](https://github.com/jrnker/CSharp-easy-RSA-PEM)

- **Proxmea.NumericTypesProperties** â€” A small project that takes types as inputs and displays the properties. Useful when working with external numbers as text and you need to declare types in classes. Or just to visualize what the types actually are.
